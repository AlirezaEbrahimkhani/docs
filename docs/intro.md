# ReactPlay

![banner](./img/banner.png)

ReactPlay is an Opensource platform to learn, create and share ReactJS projects with the developer community. You can start by browsing through many ReactJS based projects like beginners, intermediate, and advanced. It allows you to learn from the code, explanation, articles, and videos related to a project and inspire you to create one.

We call each project a play in ReactPlay. When you create a play with a few simple guided steps, it goes through some serious code reviews by experienced ReactJS developers. In the code review process, you learn several aspects of doing it right with React, "Thinking in React". After a successful code review, your play gets accepted and be part of ReactPlay to inspire many others in the community. So it is a chain to learn, create, and share all about React.
